    <b>arcdps: gw2 dps meter (and general combat metrics tool)</b><br>
    &nbsp;<span style="color:#c50c0c">WARNING: MODIFYING GUILD WARS 2 THROUGH ANY 3RD PARTY TOOLS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ARENANET OR NCSOFT.<br>
    &nbsp;THERE IS NO HELP OR WARRANTY. THIS IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK AND YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY<br> 
    &nbsp;FOR USING THIS TOOL. IF YOU FEEL THIS PROVIDES GAMEPLAY ADVANTAGE OR AUTOMATION OR BREAKS ANY OTHER<br>
    &nbsp;RULES DO NOT USE THIS.</span><br>
    &nbsp;<span style="color:#a61616">IMPORTANT: DO NOT CONTACT ARENANET SUPPORT OR REQUEST HELP ON THE OFFICIAL FORUMS WHILE USING THIS<br>
    &nbsp;MODIFICATION BY ANY MEANS OR UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EVER.</span><br><br>
    <b>how does it work</b><br>
    &nbsp;arcdps hooks client network data (among other helper functions), making it not user agreement friendly.<br>
    &nbsp;however, in the feb 2017 ama, arenanet has granted 3rd party tools permission to collect and display combat stats via means previously not allowed.<br>
    &nbsp;these are runtime modifications only, no changes are made to files on disk.<br><br>
    <b>how do i install, update, or uninstall it</b><br>
    &nbsp;save d3d9.dll into '<i>gw2 install dir/bin64/</i>' while the game is not running.<br>
    &nbsp;config will be created in '<i>gw2 install dir/addons/arcdps/</i>'.<br>
    &nbsp;to update, replace d3d9.dll.<br>
    &nbsp;expect to have to update after major game changes, be surprised when it's not necessary.<br>
    &nbsp;no official auto update but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=arcdps+auto+update">solutions exist</a>.<br>
    &nbsp;to reset, exit gw2 and remove the config folder above.<br>
    &nbsp;to disable/remove, exit gw2 and rename/delete d3d9.dll.<br><br>
    <b>how do i use it</b><br>
    &nbsp;don't be a dick.<br>
    &nbsp;by default, holding alt and shift is required for hotkeys.<br>
    &nbsp;by default, t is the hotkey for options.<br>
    &nbsp;left click on windows to interact.<br>
    &nbsp;right click on windows to bring up their independent options (if available).<br><br>
    <b>about accuracy</b><br>
    &nbsp;while two sources of data are provided (area = server strike + simulated buff; personal = chat log), neither source should be considered 100%<br>
    &nbsp;accurate. area stats will be missing damage from on-skill-activation triggers and some siphons, chat log stats will be missing some strikes from<br>
    &nbsp;aoe (guardian gs2) and condition ticks vs shroud. damage in both will always include overkill (can't detect) and healing in chat log will never<br>
    &nbsp;include overheal.<br><br>
    <b>can i chain load another wrapper d3d9.dll</b><br>
    &nbsp;arcdps will attempt to load d3d9_chainload.dll, and if found, redirect the direct3dcreate9 call to it instead of the system library.<br>
    &nbsp;make sure you are using the 64bit version of wrappers (gemfx, sweetfx).<br>
    &nbsp;you can try the loader found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/reshade_loader/">here</a> for overlay compatibility (unsupported).<br><br>
    <b>evtc logging</b><br>
    &nbsp;pve: starts on all players in combat when npc with recognized id exists nearby, stops when all players exit combat.<br>
    &nbsp;wvw: starts on player vs player damage near self, stops when all players exit combat.<br>
    &nbsp;open world: no.<br>
    &nbsp;npc id can be found via detail window and looking for species in title, or tooltip in target list after attacking.<br>
    &nbsp;logs are written to '<i>documents/gw2/addons/arcdps/arcdps.cbtlogs/.../date-time.evtc</i>' by default.<br>
    &nbsp;compression requires powershell with compress-archive.<br><br>

    &nbsp;area is missing hard cc context - not notified by server.<br>
    &nbsp;area is missing combo finishers - not notified by server.<br>
    &nbsp;area is missing some gadget owners for damage association - not notified by server.<br>
    &nbsp;area condition damage uses simulated attribute building from gear, traits, and buffs, on a simulated server tick.<br>
    &nbsp;area condition damage scaling in levels 1 to 79 is different from the game's scaling.<br>
    &nbsp;area condition damage on-skill-use procs on animation start instead of on skill use - not notified by server.<br>
    &nbsp;area strike damage notify bubble may cause some events (eg. deimos) to be out of range - not notified by server.<br>

    &nbsp;area skill activation will only count skills which have animations (no shouts, no instants) - not notified by server.<br>
    &nbsp;area overstack and applied do not include ignored stacks (lower than lowest existing stack) - not notified by server.<br><br>
    <b>it's not working</b><br>
    &nbsp;make sure <a target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads">visual studio 2015-2019 redistributable x64</a> is installed.<br>
    &nbsp;check your '<i>gw2 install dir/addons/arcdps/</i>' folder for an arcdps.log, it will appear after you launch and are in character select.<br>
    &nbsp;if you use other applications or client switches, <i>d3d9.dll</i> may need to be placed next to gw2.exe. do not place it in both locations.<br>
    &nbsp;if there is no log or error, <i>d3d9.dll</i> isn't being loaded. it is up to you to find out where your system is trying to load it from.<br>
    &nbsp;if the game crashes on or after character select, another application may be interfering (eg d3dgear, razer cortex).<br>
    &nbsp;if you get an image modified error, another application is interfering (eg antivirus, razer cortex).<br>
    &nbsp;if you get a config error, or settings not saving, make sure gw2.exe has read/write permission to the paths mentioned (or run as admin).<br>
    &nbsp;if you have a problem not listed here, see section below.<br><br>
    <b>reporting crashes, bugs, and suggestions</b><br>
    &nbsp;if you notice an issue in accuracy, <a target="_blank" href="https://i.imgur.com/77rgXNw.jpg">take a screenshot of area skill list beside personal chat list</a>, try and isolate which gear/buff/trait is the cause.<br>
    &nbsp;if you suspect arcdps as the cause of a crash, remove all addons and remove any chainload and try to repeat the crash.<br>
    &nbsp;copy the arcdps_lastcrash.log and/or the most recent arcdps.log and paste it into an unlisted <a target="_blank" href="http://pastebin.com/">http://pastebin.com/</a> paste.<br>
    &nbsp;write down the arcdps build date, the "arcdps - date" text at the bottom of the options window or in arcdps.log.<br>
    &nbsp;describe your issue with the above information included in the arcdps-issues channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/RaZ5myp">discord</a>.<br>
    &nbsp;note that arcdps replaces the gw2 crash reporter to prevent crashes from being sent to anet, this does not mean arcdps caused a crash.<br><br>
